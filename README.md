# termiauth
Terminal Based Authenticator


i was tired of these stupid authenticator apps so i made my own in javascript (cuz why the fuck not)

here just clone this repo or something and run termiauth.mjs 


you can export this from oneauth idk about others i havent really tested those so contact me here if you wan't me to test them / implement them


no stupid tracking just a minimal termiauth app :)
