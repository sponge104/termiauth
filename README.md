# termiauth
Terminal Based Authenticator


i was tired of these stupid authenticator apps so i made my own in javascript (cuz why the fuck not)

here just clone this repo or something 

run this

```bash
npm install
```


but if you want me to make it into a gui tell me or something because if enough people tell me i will do it

you can export this from oneauth idk about others i havent really tested those so contact me here if you wan't me to test them / implement them


no stupid tracking just a minimal termiauth app :)
